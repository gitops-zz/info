why
===

Because some shit like scrapers being formally legal does not makes a gread addition to our github profiles.
But scrapers of 

 - gov't sites, 
 - libraries, 
 - wikis 

are important thing to have when it comes down to *not* *forgetting*.
That's why we'll collaborate here.

what
====

We post here anything we find to be funny to do and that is formally legal.
We don't want no problems for our beloved github. 
If you want to contribute, you are welcome as you are one of us.
We also achieve important goal of showing people that they are not to be scared.
We are among them, we *are* them. We are school kids, system administrators, programmers of all trades, clercs, bakers and milkmen.
